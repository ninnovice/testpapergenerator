# Business Process Definition And Requirements #

> ## Business Objectives for Process ##

  * To formulate an online question paper for conducting examinations at the university level.

  * To reduce the chance of irrelevant or repetitive questions in the same question paper.

  * To reduce the man power and paper work there by reducing the cost for the university by more than 60 percent in cost incurring for conducting exams.

> ### 2.1 Process Flow ###

> #### 2.1.1 Existing or “As Is” Process Flow and Process Steps ####

In the current system of generating test papers which is a paper based system, includes a lot of  paper work and manual effort.  It is the time consuming process and proved inefficient over time. This system has a problem of redundancy that is repetitions of similar questions in the same question paper. Avoiding this problem would be a tedious task since one has to go through the test paper manually and check for errors and rectify them which consume more time and man power.

> ### 2.2 New Process Requirements ###

> #### A) Business Requirements ####

This product is going to serve the purpose of an automated system for generation of test papers. We are targeting at educational institutions to be our customers. By using this software one can formulate test papers within minutes avoiding redundancy and generate 2 types of test papers: general test paper and Quiz test paper. The user can easily update  previously devised test paper in a short span and moreover the test papers can be saved and displayed in different formats like pdf, ppt or word document. This product is compatible with Windows XP/2000. Works with almost any type of browser (IE, Mozilla Firefox).It comes with an installation CD and demo CD and hence very user friendly. It also incorporates a personal firewall to prevent virus.

> #### B) System Requirements ####


Operating System:- Windows 2000 prof/XP

Display test papers in Pdf,MS Word Format

> #### C) Security Requirements ####

The authorized user should be given with a  valid username and password.

> #### D) Personnel Requirements ####

> ### 2.3 Business Impact ###

> #### 2.3.1 Metrics to Measure Business Impact ####

  * Though the product is made for the non-profit organization Gannon University, the performance metrics, like the response time for generating question paper is drastically reduced.

  * The cost of risk assessment like finding defects  and removing the redundant data from the designed question papers is also decreased by more than half of the total amount.

  * An increase in the key performance indicator,used for the assessment in the universities proved the increase in standards and the quality of the education in Gannon University.


> #### 2.3.1.1 Measurable Business Metrics to be Used ####

  * Reduction in physical strain in terms of formulating test papers to more than 50% when compared to the manual method of designing test papers.

  * Ability to save the test papers without the worry of them being lost and easy updates of existing test papers.

  * Security in terms of plagiarism due to inability of accquiring access to other user accounts.

  * Ease of usage and understandablility with respect to installation and running this product

  * Built-in Firewall to reduce hazards in case of bugs or other malfunctionalities.


> #### 2.3.1.2 Responsibility of Metrics Collection & Analysis ####

> Based on the metrics collected we still have a wide scope for doing analysis on few things like

  * Optimization of the question paper generation

  * The number of users who can generate a test paper simultaneously

  * Getting the returns on the investment made on this product

  * Standing ahead in the competition


> #### 2.3.1.3 Business/System Metrics Communication Plan ####

http://testpapergenerator.googlecode.com/files/plan.JPG

> #### 2.3.2 Business Dependencies ####

> Online question paper generation process is dependent on various factors like
  * The hardware, database and the system software on the student machines where the applications runs. Here the application could be online exam Assessment tool

  * The applications it uses to perform functions within at the university level

  * The machines and the applications used by the students

> Failure in any one of the components would lead to the process failure


> #### 2.3.3 Business Risks ####
  * Physical threats such as access to unauthorized persons to information resources, computer rooms, examination questions database cannot be compromised.

  * Infrastructure failure such as internet connection failure could be a major threat as we need to be online for accessing the database or to distribute the question paper online to the students.

  * If any human mistake leads to an irrevocable loss of data it leads to wastage of many man hours to rebuild the database and it costs huge money. So we need to have a regular backups of the questions included in the database.

  * Electronic threats are the major threats in the today’s world. Hacking, phishing and spoofing would be the major threats to the university database.


> ### 2.4 Technology Impact ###

This transition in the system will make test generation much more convenient and create student tests in seconds Works seamlessly with MS-Word and other word processing software
Provides the use of multiple Test Banks to create a single student test.

> #### 2.4.1 Technology Dependencies ####

  * The use of Jsp eliminates the need for high-level technical expertise, thereby helping web developers,content creators, and content managers to work together and develop java-based applications in less time with less effort.

  * All Jsp applications run on major web server and operating system, including Microsoft iis, Netscape enterprise server, I Planet web server, and apache web server.

> #### 2.4.2 Technology Risks ####

  * Loss of data—Unable to retrieve unsaved data once lost due to various factors

  * Non involvement of personnel responsible for different tasks during the software development phase
