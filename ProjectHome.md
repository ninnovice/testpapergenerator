### Current Scenario ###

In the recent times, generating quiz papers to each student separately has proven to be a lot tedious and cumbersome mainly because the existing system is traditional paper based. It consumes more time for generating papers and there is a chance of repetition of the same questions in the same test paper. Hence we propose an alternative which diminishes the flaws in this situation.

### A Quick Fix To The Above Problem ###

The main objective is to generate test papers for conducting examinations.The proposed system is centralized system. It can be used as a plugin for conducting any kind of exam,be it online test or any general paper test. This makes it convenient to devise a test paper with one's own selection of questions or randomly generate test paper from a question bank that has already been deployed and reserved in the database. This system can be used by any Educational Institute.
It works as an aid in avoiding redundant questions in the same test paper as well as reduces manual effort and utilisation of paper to a large extent.

Test paper generator will generate two sort of test papers:-


**General Test:**

> In this case the user can select a topic from a list and choose what type of questions he wants to include in the test paper.

**Quiz Test:**

> In this case the user only has to select any topic from the list and the questions get selected by default.It includes multiple type of questions.

### Scope: ###

•	The main purpose of this project is to reduce the paper and manual work

•	It increases the productivity

•	It reduces the redundancy
