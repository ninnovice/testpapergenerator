Team Skill-1 to develop **TEST PAPER GENERATOR**



# **ANALYZING THE PROBLEM** #

---


# **1.0 Gain agreement on problem defination** #

## Current scenario ##
In the recent times, generating exam or quiz papers to each student separately has proven to be a lot tedious and cumbersome mainly because the existing system is traditional paper based. It consumes more time for generating papers and there is a chance of repetition of the same questions in the same test paper. Hence we propose an alternative which diminishes the flaws in this situation.

## Team analysis on problem statement ##
  * The main objective is to generate random test papers for conducting examinations.
  * The proposed system is going to be centralized system.
  * It can be used as a plug-in for conducting any kind of exam, be it online test or any general paper test.
  * This makes it convenient to devise a test paper with one's own selection of questions or randomly generate test paper according to the level of difficulties from a question bank that has already been deployed and reserved in the database.
  * It works as an aid in avoiding redundant questions in the same test paper as well as reduces manual effort and utilization of paper to a large extent.
  * Also system can integrate to the other system to propose and share the database to improve the educational testing.

## Who will get benefits ##
  * Academic/Educational Institute
  * Educational Testing Service Providers
  * Parents or Students
